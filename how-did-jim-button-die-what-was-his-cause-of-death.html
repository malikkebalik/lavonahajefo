As if his life wasn’t already hard enough, Button suffered a severe attack of appendicitis back in 2014, which alerted doctors to cancer in one of his kidneys. Doctors were able to remove the kidney, but unfortunately two years later Jim Button was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. <strong>This Thursday Jim Button succumbed to this disease at the age of 59</strong>. He will be remembered fondly by all who knew him, especially those whose lives he touched through his blog, “Gather With Jim”. We honor the memory of Jim Button and extend our sincerest condolences to his family and friends.</p><p>Jim Button was an incredible fighter. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness that the doctors believed would take his life in a year. But the warrior in him fought, and he managed to survive eight more years after the diagnosis. Unfortunately, he passed away yesterday, leaving behind his loved ones and all the people who respected him. His spirit of resilience will live on forever in everyone’s hearts and minds. Jim Button will always be remembered as a true warrior who never gave up.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><strong>Read this also:</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Allan M.
