Some defensive players are stronger than others, allowing them to be a force and defend their quarterback. Others, like a kicker, are smaller and more delicately built. In the NFL, there are so many various body types when it comes to weight and size. Because of this, no one noticed when former NFL player Joe Thomas’ weight was 312 pounds.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Joe-Thomas.jpg alt="Joe Thomas" width=980 height=980 sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Joe Thomas After Retirement</h2><p>Joe described his weight loss and the precise steps he took in a column for Men’s Health. “After I retired, it was incredibly simple to lose those first 20, 30, or 40 pounds,” he wrote. I simply reduced my caloric intake to eat like a regular person. But I had to eat more wisely after that. I learned my optimal protein, carb, and fat ratio as I kept track of my meals. It was a big deal for me to use the app to track my diet and realise, “Wow, this one food has so much extra sugar.”</p><h2>How Joe Thomas Lost Weight</h2><p>Joe attributes much of his weight loss to his yoga practise. “I also enjoy yoga,” he added. It makes my body feel AMAZING. It benefits my joints and serves as cardio for me. My wife bursts out laughing. She refers to it as a stretch. But it’s a wonderful workout for me because I sweat a lot. I’m now at 255. Right now, I’m attempting to shed a few pounds. I suppose that’s what everyone says.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-Joe-Thomas-Lost-Weight.jpg alt="How Joe Thomas Lost Weight" width=1280 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He also told Men’s Health that spending a lot of time in the pool helped him because his joints were so strained from his time in the NFL. “I’m doing a lot of single joint workouts,” he wrote. I also developed a passion for swimming and riding. Because I’m a bigger guy, low-impact cardio is preferable.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Facts: I think the first 25 fell off in a month, than I had to kick my butt to keep going. Swimming is the best from a cardio standpoint, and <a href=# rel=noopener>#keto</a> w/ intermittent fasting is gold. I can eat 1500-2000 cals/day and feel full. <a href=#>https://t.co/HToJA3VVat</a></p><p>— Joe Thomas (@joethomas73) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 17, 2019</a></p><p>It was really easy for me to lose those first 20, 30, 40 pounds once I retired. I simply reduced my calorie intake to eat like a normal person. But after that, I had to eat more carefully. I began to learn my ideal protein, carbohydrate, and fat ratio as I tracked my meals. Tracking things on the app and understanding, “Wow, this one food has so much added sugar,” was a game changer for me. My greatest method has been low carb yet flexible—with some intermittent fasting thrown in for good measure. Fasting offers the primary benefit for me of eliminating breakfast, which is 800-1,000 calories. Eating fats and proteins now keeps me satisfied. I only get hungrier when I consume carbs. On Christmas morning, I devoured a stack of ten pancakes baked by my wife—roughly 3,000 calories. And two hours later, I was starving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K4v46jpp5lpJ28rq3SZpmenp%2Bnsm6tzZ1kmp6kmr9w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-thomas-before-and-after-check-out-his-incredible-transformation-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ramit-sethi-net-worth-wife-kids-weight-bio-wiki-age.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ramit-sethi-net-worth-wife-kids-weight-bio-wiki-age.html>Ramit Sethi net worth, Wife, Kids, Weight, Bio-Wiki, Age</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./does-josh-dobbs-have-cancer-illness-and-health-update-2023.html>Does Josh Dobbs Have Cancer?
