The actor from Boogie Nights and his wife, Angelita, adopted her after her birth on November 14, 1995. She was given to the Guzman family so that she may receive a lot of love and attention. Briggs has, therefore, always been the source of happiness for both of her parents.</p><p>Margarita, 27, on the other hand, has led a fairly tranquil life from the start. Even more so, except her father, practically every member of the family, including her mother Angelita Galarza-Guzman, leads a rather secluded life. It is quite difficult to find out details about her early years as a result.</p><p>Happy birthday to Margarita Briggs Guzman and Yoruba…I Love You, My Awesome Kids, I’m 18 today…I’m grateful to both of you, image source: TN26pdfn8Q</p><p>We do, however, think Margarita had a wonderful upbringing. She grew up in a house with six other siblings and parents who were devoted to one another. She become a gorgeous young woman today as a result of this.</p><p>One of actor Luis Guzman’s four adopted children is Briggs Guzman, age 27. There are two biological children and four adopted children that are raised by her father and mother, Angelita. Sadly, one of Margarita’s siblings was unable to see this wonderful world.</p><p>During the birth of their first son, AD Guzman and his partner had a terrible loss. He died during birth from asphyxiation, or from being unable to breathe. Mr. and Mrs. Guzman will carry a significant scar from this sad event for the rest of their life. So they both opted to adopt rather than risk their lives by having another child.</p><p>Cami, Margarita’s oldest sibling, was adopted that year. Clare, her older sister, was later adopted. The Guzman family also welcomed Briggs and Yoruba, her identical twin, into their home. Yemaya is also one of Guzman’s children, though it is unknown for sure if she was born to the couple or was adopted.</p><p>Luckily, Mrs. Guzman gave birth to a stunning baby girl named Margarita after years of putting off having children due to her fears. She is the eldest of Luis and his wife Angelita’s children.</p><p>Everyone who is reading this essay is familiar with Luis Guzman. He is an actor from Puerto Rico who has captured the hearts of many. Additionally, after working in the film and television industries for almost 40 years now, Guzman continues to make a strong impression on his admirers.</p><p>The acting abilities of AD Guzman are outstanding! He has acted in films and TV shows ever since he began his career. Even more so, this actor has shared the stage with well-known celebrities like Jenna Ortega and Tom Cruise.</p><p>His performances in Paul Anderson’s Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love are also still highly regarded. He also gained notoriety for his work in the films Out of Sight, The Limey, and Traffic.</p><p>Additionally, Mr. Guzman delivered a standout performance in the Netflix series Narcos as well as the HBO prison drama OZ. Speaking of his more recent performances, on Wednesday he made an appearance on the show as Gomez Addams. This program is a part of the illustrious Addams Family series.</p><p>Margarita occasionally gets to walk down the red carpet with her famous father because of his fame. In the NYC premiere of We’re the Millers in 2013, she was spotted with her father.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Maya Varsano-All About Gal Gadot’s Daughter With Husband Yaron Varsano</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Christina Ashten Gourkani, A Model Who Look-Alike Kim Kardashian, Died At The Age Of 34</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfoq6zs8CroK2ZXZe%2FqrPGrGSgraqirq95y66grGWXqseurc1mmJ2noKmypXnDmqygoKSav3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmargarita-briggs-guzman-luis-guzman-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./relationship-with-dr-ronnie-goines-the-talks-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./relationship-with-dr-ronnie-goines-the-talks-today.html>Relationship with Dr. Ronnie Goines The Talks Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-blunt.html>James Blunt</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-blunt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
