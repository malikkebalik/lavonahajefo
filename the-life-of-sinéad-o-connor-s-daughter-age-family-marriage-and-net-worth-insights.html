She was born as the only child of&nbsp;the late <strong>Sinéad O'Connor&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>John Waters</strong>. Sadly, Roisin lost her mother, Sinéad, on July 26, 2023.</p><p>Despite getting fame and recognition from an early age, Roisin never thought of misusing it; instead, she made her own identity. Waters followed in her parent's footsteps and decided to contribute to the Irish music industry.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Old Is Roisin Waters? Early Life of Roisin</h2><p>Roisin Waters was brought into the spotlight because of her celebrity parents. Waters came into this materialistic world in London on&nbsp;<i>March 6, 1996</i>. On <i>March 6, 2023</i>, Roisin turned <i>27 years old.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/24/Hindisip%20(1)-min-1664015210071.jpg><p>Roisin was raised in Ireland by her famous Irish parents. Her father, John Waters, is an Irish author and musician. Similarly, her mother, Sinéad O'Connor, was a renowned singer and songwriter. Both are considered the most excellent musicians in Ireland.&nbsp;</p><p>Roisin also has lovely grandparents. Waters is the granddaughter of&nbsp;<strong>John O'Connor</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;Marie O'Connor</strong>&nbsp;and loves spending time with them.</p><h2>Roisin Waters' Parents, Sinéad O'Connor & John Waters, Were Never Married</h2><p>Yes, you heard it right; Roisin Waters' parents were never married to each other; instead, they gave birth to her while they were dating each other. Unfortunately, they could not tie the knot because of misunderstandings and frequent conflicts like<a href=# rel=nofollow> <i><strong>Lucy Iglesias's parents</strong></i></a>.</p><p>As per online tabloids, the former couple dated in&nbsp;<i>1995</i>, and within one year, they could not stick to their relationship and got apart in&nbsp;<i>1996</i>. As a result, their beautiful relationship ended at a complete stop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/17/Late%20Sin%C3%A9ad%20O'Connor%20was%20photographed%20with%20her%20daughter%20Roisin%20Waters%20and%20her%20daughter-1692256280602.jpg"><p>However, within that one year, Sinead was already pregnant since she had Roisin Waters in her belly. After the separation, she still decided to give birth to her despite her family being against her.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of Sinead's bravery and love for her unborn child, she went against her family and allowed Waters to see the world. But things wouldn't turn out to be like how the singer wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>So, who raised Roisin? Well, both Sinend and John Waters wanted custody of Roisin. After her birth O'Connor and Waters had an ugly battle over Roisin's guardianship. At the end of the verdict, John got custody of his daughter.</p><h2>Roisin Waters' Mother Married Three Times</h2><p>Roisin Waters' mother, Sinéad O'Connor, has been married three times to different men. Roisin's mom, O'Connor, married&nbsp;<strong>John Reynolds</strong>, a record producer and musician. They exchanged vows in&nbsp;<i>1987&nbsp;</i>and separated just after three years of marriage, i.e.,&nbsp;<i>1991</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/24/PopSugar%20(1)-min-1664015644889.jpg><p>After separating from Reynolds, she started dating Waters' father, John. As mentioned earlier, they stick together for only one year.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after breaking up, Sinead decided to remain single and started living a single life until she met journalist&nbsp;<strong>Nicholas Sommerlad</strong>. Ever since their first meeting, they connected and decided to exchange vows in&nbsp;<i>2001</i>.</p><p>After exchanging rings and vows, the former couple shared the same beds and roofs for only three years as they divorced in&nbsp;<i>2003</i>. Their relationship ended on a nasty note.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/24/Independent%20(1)-min-1664015525064.jpg><p>Thenceforth, Sinead tied the knot with Australian-Irish musician <strong>Steve Cooney</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>2010</i>. Unfortunately, this relationship could not go further, as they went their separate way in&nbsp;<i>2011</i>.</p><h2>Roisin Waters Has Three Half-Brothers</h2><p>The celebrity daughter Roisin Waters is blessed with three lovely half-siblings from her mother's side. Roisin has one elder brother named&nbsp;<strong>Jake Reynolds </strong>and two younger brothers named&nbsp;<strong>Shane Lunny</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Yeshua Bonadio</strong>.</p><p>Jake currently serves as a musical artist in Ireland, whereas Yeshua is enjoying her childish life. He is the son of Sinéad O'Connor and&nbsp;<strong>Frank Bonadio</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about Shane, Roisin's mother, O'Connor, lost custody of her son as well. Sadly, Shane is no longer with us as he was found dead on&nbsp;<strong>January 7, 2022</strong>, in Bray, Ireland. He was the child of Sinéad O'Connor and&nbsp;<strong>Donal Lunny</strong>. According to the police investigation, Shane committed suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>(<i>Fun Fact</i>: Water's mother, Sinead, was never married to Frank and Donal. Similar to John, she just dated them. However, she surprisingly became a mother. Regarding Jake's father's identity, it is still a mystery.)</p><h3>Roisin Waters' Mother, Sinéad O'Connor, Passed Away at Age 56</h3><p>Roisin Waters faced the tragic loss of her mother in 2023. Sinéad O'Connor passed away at age 56 on &nbsp;July 26, 2023. Sinéad's family held a funeral on August 8th in <i>Bray, County Wicklow</i>. Similarly, thousands of fans attended O'Connor's funeral bearing signs and tributes.</p><p>While the reason for Roisin's mother's death remains within the family, the authorities didn't treat the singer's death with suspicion.
