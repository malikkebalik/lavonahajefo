But 20 years since Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston made their relationship public, another chapter might be startingfor these two.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Ever since Pitt effectively parted ways with his former wife Angelina Jolie, finalizing their divorce in 2019, there have been <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/brad-pitt-one-last-people-21129721>insisting rumors</a> about Pitt and Jolie getting back together. (There is nothing confirmed on this matter as of December 19).</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. I Image: Getty Images.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>With this in mind, let’s take a look back in time to revisit the love story between two of the biggest stars to come out of the ‘90s.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>BEGINNINGS</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Pitt and Aniston first met casually in 1994, when “Friends” was about to become a cultural phenomenon, launching Aniston to superstardom, and Pitt was building a big screen reputation with roles in “Interview with the Vampire” and “Seven.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The two performers had a manager in common, and Aniston recalled how ordinary Pitt seemed to her back then. “He was just this sweet guy from Missouri, you know? A normal guy,” Aniston said about <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/interview-jennifer-aniston-171848/>her first impression</a> of the actor.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. I Image: Getty Images.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Nothing worthy of mention happened between the two at that moment, when Pitt was dating Gwyneth Paltrow and Aniston was in a relationship with Tate Donovan.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>STARTING TO DATE</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 1998, as it only happens in Hollywood, Pitt and Aniston went on their first date, set up by their manager after the two had ended their previous relationships.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Whoever had the idea of pairing them really had a vision, for after that practically blind date, as Aniston shared with Diane Sawyer later, the two actually felt a strong connection since day one.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt. I Image: Getty Images.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“We both [knew] on our first date. It was weird… That was a really easy evening.

I Image: Getty Images.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>It was hard for them to surf their busy schedules and use any free time to spend time together, and it later surfaced that Pitt secretly traveled to Texas to accompany Aniston as she filmed <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_42">“Office Space.”</a></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>According to Aniston former co-star in the comedy film, Greg Pitts, Aniston stayed in<a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/2/19/18228673/office-space-oral-history> a different hotel</a> than the rest of the cast, where she could meet with Pitt in private, but, apparently, they weren’t fooling anyone, and there was already a hunt for a picture of the two together.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>GOING PUBLIC</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>After testing the grounds with their inner circle of friends, with Pitt throwing a 30th birthday party for Aniston at Sunset Boulevard in February 1999, and taking a romantic trip to Acapulco to think things over, they were ready to open up.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt.

The much-anticipated wedding, celebrated<a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-isnt-it-romantic-vol-54-no-7/> in Malibu, California</a>, with about 200 lucky guests, didn’t disappoint.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>People reported at the time, the occasion was marked with 50,000 flowers, four bands, a gospel choir, and fireworks. Aniston was escorted down the aisle by her father, “Days of Our Lives” <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030100/>actor John Aniston</a>.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Jennifer’s “Friends” co-stars Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Lisa Kudrow, were in attendance.
