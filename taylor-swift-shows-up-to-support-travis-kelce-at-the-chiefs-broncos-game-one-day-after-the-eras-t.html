<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>One day after the Los Angeles premiere of her “Eras Tour” movie on Wednesday night, Taylor Swift returned to Kansas City for the Chiefs’ NFL game against the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Swift has now attended three of the tight end’s past four games since she was originally linked to Travis Kelce of the Chiefs, providing the NFL a significant rating bump and igniting a media frenzy, with color commentators even commenting on the pattern during the game.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>About 45 minutes before kickoff, at 6:30 local time, Swift arrived at the game. With the help of Travis Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce, she made her way to an opulent suite at the GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium without any delay.</p><p>Swift came “in the building” during Thursday Night Football’s pregame broadcast, but the program did not originally make a big deal out of it.</p><p>A tiny footage of her relaxing in the suite was shown on the Prime Video broadcast a short while later. Following that, Kelce gave a pre-recorded interview in which the tight end discussed his connection with Swift.</p><p>Swift wore a Chiefs jacket from the WEAR collection of Erin Andrews. Swift received certain pieces from Andrews’ brand in the hopes that she would wear one in the future, Andrews recently revealed to Variety.</p><p>The singer-songwriter joined Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds in the stands for the Chiefs-Jets game two weeks ago.</p><p>On that particular Sunday, NBC’s Sunday Night Football received almost 27 million viewers. Additionally, when Swift first entered the NFL, Kelce’s jersey sales climbed by a startling 400%.</p><p>When the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Chicago Bears in Week 3 of the NFL season, the Swift football craze started, and as of Week 5, the hype surrounding her participation at Chiefs games hasn’t subsided.</p><p>Swift’s enormous popularity was quickly tapped into by the NFL, which posted about her on social media and regularly included her in broadcasts.</p><p>Other companies are also profiting. Heinz created a special “Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch” version of its condiment mix after a picture of Swift at a game with the caption “Taylor Swift was eating a piece of chicken with ketchup and seemingly ranch” went viral.</p><p>Even the Empire State Building adopted red and white as its new colors in remembrance of the image.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-1024x576.jpg><p>The singer joined other famous guests including Beyoncé and Adam Sandler in Los Angeles on Wednesday night for the debut of her concert film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” at the AMC Grove Theatre.</p><p>Before the movie premiered, Swift addressed the “hand-selected” group of fans and supporters, stating, “I’ve always had pleasure doing this.</p><p>Incredibly, I get to do music as a living. I’ve never in my life had as much fun as I have on the “Eras Tour.” It is by far the most exciting experience I have ever had.</p><p>She said in her closing statement, <strong>“I think the fans will see — and the dancers, you’ll all see — how much you are main characters in this film. And I love you so much. I appreciate you being here because this night is a core memory for me and you’re a part of it. And you decided you wanted to spend your evening here with us. So I hope you have fun. I hope you love it so much.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Here is Evidence That Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Father Have Already Bonded.</strong></h2><p>On October 12, Taylor Swift watched the Kansas City Chiefs play the Denver Broncos at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. This was the singer’s third Chiefs game this year, as romance rumors about her and Travis Kelce have persisted.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor Kelce and his mother Donna Kelce were once more observed conversing and celebrating throughout the game in a stadium suite.</p><p>And based on the fact that she was seen chatting with Travis Kelce’s father Ed Kelce, it appears that the 12-time Grammy winner also got to spend time with another Kelce family member.</p><p>However, youngster, Taylor and Travis’ parents weren’t alone themselves. Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback for the Chiefs, and his wife Brittany joined them in the suite.</p><p>After Patrick passed the ball to Travis in an important play, she and Taylor were spotted hugging joyfully.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51ktbC4y7KuqKeUZMGzrdWiqmajlaGwpnnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1kpZ2Rq7JuwM6gnK2glad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-shows-up-to-support-travis-kelce-at-the-chiefs-broncos-game-one-day-after-the-eras-t.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tori-gomez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tori-gomez.html>Tori Gomez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tamara-craig-thomas.html>Tamara Craig Thomas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tamara-craig-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
