<time>26 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Some of the few people who have been famous in the very young age despite low family background they have been hard-working throughout their life. Today we are going to talk about the same person who is the host of <i>YouTube Nation</i> and Producer of <i>HuffPost Live</i>, <strong>Jacob Soboroff</strong>.</p><h2>Early life and career</h2><p>Jacob Soboroff was born on <i>27 March 1983</i> in Los Angeles, California. He is the eldest child of <strong>Patti </strong>and the president of the <i>Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners</i>, <strong>Steve Soboroff</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>He attended <i>Harvard Westlake School</i> and was later graduated from the <i>New York University</i> with <i>Bachelor of Arts in politics</i> and <i>Master of Arts in political theory</i>. While he was in college, he aided to <strong>Michael R. Bloomberg,</strong> who is the Mayor of New York City.</p><h3>Life after graduation</h3><p>Jacob has contributed to MTV's 2012 presidential election coverage. He is one of the founders of<i> AMC News</i> where he took interviews of various filmmakers and actors. He is one of the contributors for<i> CNN</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/11/3-1568184131336.JPG><p>Later in Mid December 2014, he has seen as the host of YouTube news show named as<i> YouTube Nation</i>. He was invited by authorities to tour <i>Casa Padre</i> ( a facility in Texas housing 1500 boys). He is very active in various social works and was a speaker at <i>TEDActive 2011</i>.</p><h3>Award-winning personality</h3><p>For his Excellence in Television Political Journalism, he was among the winners of the <i>10th biennial Walter Cronkite Awards</i>, which was announced by the<i> USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</i>. Alongside with <strong>Walter Cronkite,</strong> he was honored by <i>USC Annenberg</i> in the Individual Achievement by a National Journalist.</p><h2>Family and his four sibling</h2><p>Jacob keeps his personal life a little bit private. He doesn't usually talk about his personal matter to any media. He is the eldest son of his family following four siblings. He has three sisters and one brother who particularly are very focused in their career.&nbsp;</p><p>Jacob is seen as very helpful to his siblings. Being the eldest son in the family, he is still supporting his siblings by every means possible.</p><h3>The happily married couple blessed with the son</h3><p>Jacob is happily married to his long-time girlfriend, <strong>Nicole Cari</strong>. The couple gets married on June 14, 2012, and they seem happy with each other. Being married for seven years, they are blessed with the beautiful son, born on December 4, 2015.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/11/1-1568184061289.JPG><p>Jacob is often seen posting his wife and son's photos on his Instagram account. Although the happily married couple is busy, they manage to give time to each other whenever they are free. Reportedly the couple is seen vacationing in the <i>Washington Square Park</i>.</p><h3>Past Affairs</h3><p>Jacob met the beautiful actress <strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong> while he was making a documentary. Kirsten Dunst is famous for the role in&nbsp;<i>The Vampire </i>and<i> Spider-Man Trilogy</i>. The couple started dating on November 22. After dating for a couple of months, the duo broke up and followed their own path.</p><h2>How much Jacob Soboroff earns?</h2><p>Same as other journalists like <a href=#><strong>Luke Russert</strong></a>, Jacob Soboroff earn a pretty good fortune from his work. According to the online source, the average salary of a Journalist is <strong>$45,845 </strong>yearly. And being a talented journalist, his company might have added him some more fund to his account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/11/4-1568183962934.JPG><p>Besides, he is a host and producer of <i>HuffPost Live</i>, <i>TakePart Live,&nbsp;</i>and <i>YouTube Nation </i>from which he might have earned a very good fortune to his wealth. However, his net worth has not been yet estimated. The 36 years old journalist is very much keen on traveling different place and is very much food lover. He often posts his travel photos and videos on his Instagram account with his family and friends.</p><p>For more information regarding different celebrities, please visit <a href=#>Married celeb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqOYnKeSYsCwrs6rpp%2Be</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnbc-correspondent-jacob-soboroff-relationship-status-and-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rickey-eugene-brown-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rickey-eugene-brown-net-worth.html>Rickey Eugene Brown Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kendall-jenner-siblings-growing-up-with-superstar-siblings.html>Kendall Jenner Siblings: Growing Up With Superstar Siblings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kendall-jenner-siblings-growing-up-with-superstar-siblings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
