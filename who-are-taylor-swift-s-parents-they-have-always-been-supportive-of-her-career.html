In fact, Taylor Swift's mom has a song in the "Fearless" album dedicated to her.</p><p class=dh>When Taylor Swift's "Fearless" album was released and made waves in the music scene, her parents were dealing with an unstable marriage and, ultimately, a divorce.</p><p class=dh>The singer wrote and dedicated one of the album's songs, "The Best Day," to her mom, Andrea, as a surprise. By listening to the lyrics, fans can immediately see the close mother-daughter relationship.</p><p class=dh>"'The Best Day' is a song that I wrote without telling my mom. I wrote it in the summertime, and I recorded it secretly, too," Taylor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-mom-the-best-day/>said</a>. In the song, Taylor revealed that Andrea was her only friend at 13, who would make her feel happy when it seemed like things were falling apart.</p><p class=dh>Taylor wrote about her parents again on her "Speak Now" album, released after Andrea and Scott's divorce. In the song "Mine," Taylor mentioned her parents' fights and their effect on their kids.</p><p class=dh>"You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/taylor-swift-dad-parents-divorce-separated/>wrote</a> from the perspective of being in a relationship and arguing with her special someone.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Taylor Swift's Mother Took Her Daughter to Nashville to Visit Record Labels</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Andrea, born on January 10, 1958, was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/taylor-swift-parents-4577531/>introduced to music</a> at a young age. Her mother, Taylor's grandmother Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer and celebrity.</p><p class=dh>At 11 years old, Taylor already knew music was her passion, so Andrea took her to Nashville to visit different record labels. As the "You Belong With Me" songstress recalled, Andrea waited in the car with her son, Austin, while her daughter introduced herself to various record houses. Taylor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/article/2008/02/05/taylor-swifts-road-fame/>narrated</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I would say, 'Hi, I'm Taylor. I'm 11.

Three years later, her country music career launched in Tennessee. Her parents never disclosed why they moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville to avoid possible guilt their daughter may feel.</p><p class=dh>As Taylor pursued her career, Andrea always stayed by her daughter's side, traveling on tour while helping the young entertainer finish her studies on the road. Meanwhile, Scott took care of Austin at home.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Taylor Swift Reported on Her Mother's Cancer</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Amidst the height of her fame, Taylor revealed her mother's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-mom-cancer-tumblr-6531049/>cancer diagnosis </a>to the public in 2015. Although she kept the details of Andrea's illness and treatments private, Taylor dedicated the song "Soon You'll Get Better" to her mom in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/894fd58c6161657dccd746ec16bbd290.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Scott Swift, Taylor Swift, and Andrea Swift during the 48th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on April 7, 2013, in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Around that time, Andrea's cancer had returned, and doctors discovered a brain tumor. During an interview, the singer credited her mom for being a constant source of motivation and guidance throughout her life. "Obviously, it was a really big deal to ever speak about her illness," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2020/music/features/taylor-swift-politics-sundance-documentary-miss-americana-1203471910/>added</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Taylor Swift's Father Also Had Cancer</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, Scott, born on March 5, 1952, was also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26628467/taylor-swift-30th-birthday-lessons/&nbsp;>diagnosed</a> with cancer. Taylor also kept the details of her father's illness private but shared the life lessons she learned from her parents' health struggles.</p><p class=dh>Although Taylor talks about her mom more, it is known that <a class="me a" href=#>Scott Swift </a>was a stockbroker and launched the Swift Group as part of Merrill Lynch. When their family moved to Nashville in 2004, Scott had to relocate his business as well.</p><p class=dh>He also used his connections to get Taylor an opportunity to sing the National Anthem at the 2008 World Series. Once, Scott made a sweet gesture by giving away pizza to his daughter's fans, who waited for Taylor's performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcG1kZXq4tM5mmKudXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwbR5z5qpnqakqHq1tMSyZKGZppp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-taylor-swift-s-parents-they-have-always-been-supportive-of-her-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aimee-teegarden-husband-bio-wiki-height-net-worth-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aimee-teegarden-husband-bio-wiki-height-net-worth-more.html>Aimee Teegarden Husband, Bio, Wiki, Height, Net Worth &amp;amp; more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./super-bowl-2024-performers-all-about-the-halftime-show-reba-mcentire-s-performance-more-detail.html>Super Bowl 2024 Performers: All About the Halftime Show, Reba McEntires Performance &amp;amp; More Detail</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./super-bowl-2024-performers-all-about-the-halftime-show-reba-mcentire-s-performance-more-detail.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
