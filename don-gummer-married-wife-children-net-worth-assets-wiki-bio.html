But the incident was by no means a memorable one (not at least in a positive way). Meryl Streep was just in the mourning phase after her then-boyfriend, <strong>John Cazale</strong> (of&nbsp;The Godfather and the Deer Hunter) had died of bone cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/streep-and-gummer-1979-dorothy-chandler-pavilion-la-music-center-1518649178.jpg><p><strong>Source: Tom and Country Magazine</strong></p><p>Devastated by her lover’s passing, Streep turned to a friend of her brother’s. And that friend turned out to be no one but Don Gummer, himself. For the time being, Gummer was also off of his relationship with former wife, <strong>Peggy Lucas.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“She took care of him like there was nobody else on earth,” director <strong>Joe Papp</strong> accounted of Streep’s relationship with Cazale in Michael Schulman’s&nbsp;Her Again: Becoming Meryl Streep.</p><p>The then 29-year-old Streep stayed in Gummer’s apartment during the shooting of&nbsp;Kramer vs. Kramer. Consequently,&nbsp;Kramer vs. Kramer became the first film to win her an Oscar.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Daniel John Gregory’s Married Life, Husband, Children</a></strong></p><p>Six months after Cazale’s death, Gummer and Streep married in the garden of her parent’s home in September 1978.</p><p>“I haven’t got over John’s death, but I’ve got to go on living and Don has shown me how to do that.”</p><p>Mrs. Gummer explained her decision to prompt marriage with Don Gummer.</p><p>In the beginning, even Streep’s mother questioned the couple’s quick marriage. Fast forward to 2019 and the Hollywood still can’t stop&nbsp;boasting the Gummer-Streep’s 40+ years of togetherness.</p><p><strong>Don’t Miss:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor LaShae Dating, Boyfriend, Partner, Relationship, Net Worth, Salary, Makeup, Age, Height, Facts, Wiki-Bio</a></strong></p><p>So yes, Gummer and Streep are still going strong, supporting each other in their careers.

As for the parents, they are currently living as far away from Hollywood as possible in Salisbury, Connecticut.</p><p>This year, come March, the duo is looking forward to celebrating their 41st anniversary.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Don_Gummer%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth></span>Don Gummer’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>By profession, Meryl’s husband, Don Gummer is a renowned sculptor whose current estimated fortune is approximately&nbsp;<strong>$10 million.</strong> Gummer made this figure mainly from his tabletop and wall-mounted sculpture, as well as his large free-standing works, often in bronze.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gettyimages-1573491001.jpg><p><strong>Source: Heavy</strong></p><p>Various art houses like the&nbsp;Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio,&nbsp;Evansville Museum of Arts, History, and Science exhibit his notable features. &nbsp;And also his an outdoor sculpture, Open Eyes&nbsp;and&nbsp;The South Tower which stays at&nbsp;Indiana University, and Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, respectively.</p><p>Don Gummer also involved in some publishing works with one of his books, The Lyrical Constructivist (2001).
