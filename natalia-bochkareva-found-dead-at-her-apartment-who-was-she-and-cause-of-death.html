He governed Penza Oblast from 1998 to 2015.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>Natalia Bochkareva previously made headlines after she got scammed of £136,000 by a self-proclaimed fortune-teller.

Many of them are linked to the energy sector and conspiracy theorists believe they were apparent murders. Netizens call it “Russian sudden death syndrome.”</p><p>Natalia Bochkareva is the latest victim of the phenomenon. In January 2023, Magomed Abdulayev, 61, close to ex-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev was killed after a car rammed his vehicle in Makhachkala on the Caspian Sea.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>Before that, oil tycoon Ravil Maganov, 67, fell to his death from the sixth floor of a Moscow hospital in September last year.
