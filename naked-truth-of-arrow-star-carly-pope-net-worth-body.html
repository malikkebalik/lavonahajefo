She was a part of the CW show “Arrow”, for its 2016 season, and also appeared in the series “Suits”.</p><h2><span id=The_Net_Worth_of_Carly_Pope>The Net Worth of Carly Pope</span></h2><p>As of early-2020, Carly Pope’s net worth is estimated to be over $2 million, earned through a successful career in acting since the mid-1990s. While she is mostly known for her television work, she’s also appeared in a number of films, which have won her a few awards.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_Education_and_Career_Beginnings>Early Life, Education, and Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Carly grew up in Vancouver, the middle child of three. Like her older brother, she developed an interest in acting at a young age, and with her love for performing, her parents supported her when she took dance classes, and then became more active in theatre when she reached high school. She attended Lord Byng Secondary School and participated in plays both in the school as well as more professional productions held within the locality.</p><p>Some of her notable projects during this period included “The Odd Couple”, and a rendition of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in which she portrayed Titania – the play is one of the most popular creations of Shakespeare, and is often produced all around the world.

She appeared opposite Leslie Bibb in the show which tells the story of two girls who are in opposite spectrums in terms of popularity in high school, but are forced to become closer when their parents marry.</p><p>During this time, she was gaining attention for her attractiveness, leading her to be named as one of the Hottest Stars Under 25 by “Teen People” magazine.</p><p>In the following years, she was featured on covers of popular magazines, and also did photoshoots, so embarking on a bit of modeling work.

Some of the models who have been so honored include Miranda Kerr, Anne Vyalitsyna and Emily Ratajkowski.</p><h2><span id=Continued_Acting_Work>Continued Acting Work</span></h2><p>Throughout the 2000s, Carly continued taking on both television and film roles. She appeared in “Orange County”, “Finder’s Fee” and “The Glass House”, the latter starred Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgard in the story of siblings who lose their parents in an accident, leading them to live in an isolated glass house owned by old family neighbors who turn out to be crazy. The film didn’t earn well at the box office,&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>bombing</a>&nbsp;mainly because its release date was near the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>Her next notable project was in the film “The Collector”, in which she played Maya Kadinski.

The show starred Kiefer Sutherland and as the name denotes, it tells of the “24” hours within the day – each episode is an hour into the events of an important day which often involves Kiefer’s character, who is a part of a Counter Terrorist Unit. The following year, she became a regular cast member of the show “Outlaw” which was short-lived, canceled after only airing eight episodes.</p><p>In 2016, she was cast in another notable role in the television series “Arrow”, which is based on the DC character Green Arrow, playing Susan Williams for around 10 episodes.
