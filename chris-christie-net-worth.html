As of early 2016, the Republican’s wealth is reported by authoritative sources to be $4 million, gained mostly from his long years of practicing law and service in public office.</p><p>Christie grew up in Newark, New Jersey to parents Wilbur James and Sondra. He attended Livingston High School and graduated in 1980. His passion for the world of politics started when former state legislator Tom Kean gave a speech to his class, and he ended up volunteering for his gubernatorial campaign when he was fifteen years old. In 1984 he graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in political science and later on studied law at the Seton Hall University School of Law.</p><h3>Chris Christie Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>In 1987, he started his career by working in the law firm Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci specializing in election law, securities law, appellate practice, and government affairs.

Bush’s</a> campaign in 1992, and then in 1994 was elected to the Board of Chosen Freeholders for Morris County.</p><p>He started his political career officially in 1995 by running for a seat in the New Jersey General assembly, unfortunately he lost to John Murphy. but in 2001 he was appointed as the US Attorney for the District of New Jersey, though he faced some oppositions because of lack of experience. Regardless, by 2002 he once again won, and appointed to become the Chief Federal Law Enforcement Officer in New Jersey, in which position he served until 2008. His popularity increased due to his effective leadership, especially in decreasing corruption during his term – he was able to convict over a hundred local officials both Republicans and Democratic alike.</p><p>In 2009, Christie ran for office to be the Governor of New Jersey and defeated <a href=#>Jon Corzine</a>.
