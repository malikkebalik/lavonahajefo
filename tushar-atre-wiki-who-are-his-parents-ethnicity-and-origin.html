<time>07 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>After his tragic demise as the Santa Cruz-based CEO of the digital marketing company AtreNet Inc., Tushar Atre’s parents are in the spotlight. On October 1, 2019, deputies from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office discovered the body of Tushar Atre, 50.</strong></p><p>Atre was stabbed and shot at his marijuana farm on Soquel San Jose Road, near the top of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The murder trial for tech and cannabis entrepreneur Tushar Atre was resumed in July in Santa Cruz Superior Court.</p><p>This occurred more than three years after four individuals were accused of killing the Pleasure Point businessman during an apparently failed heist. A 48 Hours episode from the 18th season of Investigation Discovery’s 48 Hours centers on the horrific kidnapping and murder of Tushar Atre.</p><p>The episode explores the sad occurrences in October 2019, and it airs on January 9, 2023, at 10 p.m. ET. Despite the horrific nature of the murder, this incident highlights the terrible life lost and emphasizes the need for a relentless pursuit of justice. As a result, Tushar Atre and his family are now more popular.</p><h2>Tushar Atre’s Parents: Where Do They Come From?</h2><p>There is growing curiosity concerning Tushar Atre’s parents and lineage as a result of the tragic circumstances surrounding his case. Atre’s background is unknown because his family’s information has been kept private. The horrifying kidnapping, murder, and accompanying inquiry bring the crime’s seriousness to light, while his career accomplishments shed light on his character.</p><p>He gained notoriety as the founder of the Santa Cruz-based digital marketing company AtreNet Inc. and a tech billionaire. Additionally, Atre was working with his Soquel San Jose Road company in Santa Cruz to create medicinal cannabis products. In a startling turn of events, Atre was taken hostage from his beach house, seen on security tape, and forcibly removed by attackers.</p><p>Visitors to Atre’s house heard someone ask for a safe, then there was a disturbance. However, neither a forced entrance nor a search for commodities were discovered by authorities. During the investigation, it was found that $80,000 was concealed in a safe in a bedroom that the attackers were unable to open.</p><p>More CCTV footage revealed Atre running away while restrained down a street in his neighborhood. His body was found near his place of employment after his life was forcefully taken; the remains showed signs of severe brutality, including multiple knife wounds and a fatal gunshot.</p><h2>Tushar Atre Family Background: Upbringing And Ethnicity</h2><p>Tushar Atre’s family, ethnicity, and upbringing are unknown because so little information has been made public about them, as was previously stated. But there is access to information on his girlfriend, who is important in the context of his homicide case. Rachael Emerlye, his business partner as well as personal companion, and Tushar Atre, 50, had a close relationship.</p><p>Their combined professional endeavors and their romantic relationship were closely connected. Because of her relationship with Tushar Atre at the time, Rachael Emerlye attracted attention. Even yet, it’s hard to find comprehensive information about her. She was well recognized for founding and leading Benevolent Bound, a cannabis business. Their long-distance relationship endured because they placed a high value on privacy and refused to disclose any marriage plans.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>CEO of the digital marketing company</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Maverick Carter | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Maverick Carter is a well-known American sports marketing entrepreneur and media figure.
