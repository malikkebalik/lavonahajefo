In both 2020 and 2021, Chestnut set a new record by eating 75 hot dogs and buns in less than 10 minutes.</strong></p><h2><span id=Joey_Chestnut_asked_her_to_marry_him>Joey Chestnut asked her to marry him</span></h2><p>Chestnut and Ricasa had been dating for three years when Chestnut proposed to Ricasa in 2014, just before Nathan’s hot dog eating contest. Ricasa was surprised because she had not expected it. Chestnut knelt on one and proposed to her, saying that the previous three years had been the happiest of his life and that he couldn’t live without her. Ricasa responded positively. The couple divorced the following year, before their wedding date.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Neslie_Ricasa_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Neslie Ricasa? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Her net worth has yet to be determined. We now know her ex’s net worth, which she is well-known for. Chestnut has a net worth of <strong>$2.5 million</strong>. His annual salary is $500,000.</p><h2><span id=Is_Neslie_Ricasa_Single_Relationship>Is Neslie Ricasa Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Ricasa moved on with her life following her divorce from Chestnut. Drew Ely had been her boyfriend for three years prior to their marriage on August 3, 2019. They are still together. The couple has two children: Dexter, a boy, and Harley, a girl. Their elder daughter, Harley Maverick Nancye, was born on December 29, 2019, and their son, Dexter, was born in April 2021.</p><p>Ricasa’s Instagram account, Neslie Ely, continues to feature photos of her family. According to his Facebook page, her husband works as an elevator technician at Star Elevator. The family has relocated to San Jose, California.</p><h2><span id=How_did_her_ex-boyfriend_Joey_Chestnut_become_interested_in_food_and_what_is_he_doing_to_prepare_for_Nathan8217s_Hot_Dog_Contest>How did her ex-boyfriend Joey Chestnut become interested in food, and what is he doing to prepare for Nathan’s Hot Dog Contest?</span></h2><p>On The Transition podcast, Joey talked about how he started eating and how he prepared for Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest. According to Chestnut, he was always the family’s biggest eater, which embarrassed him. His mother would become irritated with him and tell him that he needed to save money for his brothers as well.</p><p>His younger brother, a huge fan of Japanese competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi, expected him to beat him and sign him up for the competition.</p><p>Because Chestnut was shy and embarrassed about eating too much, he didn’t attend the first event, but the organizer promised him a free hotel room if he attended the second. At the time, he was 21 years old. He claimed that because the hotel has a casino, the casino sold it to him. “Oh my God,” he remembered thinking as he stepped onto the platform for the first time.</p><p>Chestnut claims that once he starts eating, he feels compelled to eat more. He doesn’t get full as quickly as other people, but he can go a day and a half without eating, allowing him to cleanse. Chestnut ensures that he enters each competition somewhat depleted. In preparation for a large-capacity competition, he fasts for more than a day.</p><p>When asked how he prepares for Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, he stated that he does a hot dog practice once a week on average, followed by a full-fledged contest where he heats up the hot dogs. He fasts for a day and a half before practice. It’s just high fiber after practice, and even if he’s not hungry, he’ll be eating lettuce and greens and trying to get that stuff through him. He claims that during practice, he consumes more hot dogs than on game day.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
