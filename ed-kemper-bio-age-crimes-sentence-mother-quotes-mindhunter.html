His father was a World War II veteran who tested nuclear weapons in the Pacific Proving Grounds after the war. He later returned to California where he worked as an electrician.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>By the time he was 4 years old, he was already a head taller than his peers. However much he was highly intelligent, he exhibited behavior such as cruelty to animals. When he was 10 years old, he buried a cat alive and once it died, he dug it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike. He later stated that he got great pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When he was 13 years old, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favouring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper over him and kept its pieces in his closet until his mother found them. He used to perform rituals with his younger sister’s dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands as one of his dark , and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied: “If I kiss her, I’d have to kill her first.”</p><p>His favorite&nbsp;games a she was a kid was Gas Chamber and Electric Chair;&nbsp;he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He had a close relationship with his father and when his parents separated in 1957, he was so devastated. The breaking up caused him to be raised by his mother Clarnell in Helena, Montana. His mother was&nbsp;a&nbsp;neurotic, domineering&nbsp;alcoholic&nbsp;who would frequently belittle, humiliate and abuse him. This made him have a dysfunctional relationship with her. She used to mock him and made him sleep in a locked basement as she feared he could hurt his sisters.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>When he was 15 years old, he ran away from home to go reconcile with his father in Van Nuys, California where he learned that his father had remarried and had another son. His father sent him to stay with his grandparents after he had lived with him for a little while. His grandparents lived in North Fork where he hated so much.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Ed Kemper Mom</h2><p>His mother’s name is Clarnell Elizabeth Kemper.</p><h2>Ed Kemper Sisters</h2><p>He has two sisters Susan Hughey Kemper and Allyn Lee Kemper</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Ed Kemper Dating</h2><p>After he had moved out of his mother’s house, he began working for the Highway Department.

Chafed by the contention, Kemper raged off and got a rifle that his granddad had given him for chasing. He at that point came back to the kitchen and lethally shot his grandma in the head before discharging twice more into her back.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When his grandparents arrived home from grocery shopping, he went outside and shot him fatally in the driveway.&nbsp;He was uncertain of what to do straightaway thus called his mom, who asked him to contact the nearby police. He then called the police and hung tight for them to arrest him. Upon questioning, he said that he just wanted to see what it felt like to kill grandma and that he killed his grandpa so that he would not have to find out that his wife was dead.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>His crimes deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit and court diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic before he got sent to the Atascadero State Hospital.
