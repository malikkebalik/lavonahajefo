The selfless act was a way to honor the girl's mother, who had just passed away.</p><p class=dh>This year, attendees of the Forrest County Agricultural High School's Homecoming witnessed a special moment. After senior pupil Nyla Covington won the crown, she walked toward Brittany Walters and did something unexpected.</p><p class=dh>Covington first gave Walters a big hug and then took off the crown and placed it on her head. At first, the student could not accept the honor, and she tried to back away from Covington. However, after she spoke with her, Walters accepted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f005abea22b326a4c195b3100d9dc82e.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A homecoming queen prompts an emotional reaction as she hands her crown to another student who just lost her mother to cancer | Photo: Facebook/RickKarle</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>YOUR MOM'S QUEEN</strong></p><p class=dh>Covington shared the extraordinary encounter and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wlox.com/2021/10/01/fcahs-homecoming-queen-gives-crown-student-who-lost-mom-cancer/>said</a>: "I was like, 'No, come here, get it, you're your mom's queen.' I wanted her to know that." Walters' mother had passed away the very same day as their homecoming.</p><p class=dh>Walters expressed she felt her mother's presence on the field with her. She also likened her mom to Convington and said they shared similar traits. According to Walters, both of them are very giving and caring towards others.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SPECIAL HOMECOMING MEMORIES</strong></p><p class=dh>The day was overwhelming for Walters, but she attended the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wtva.com/content/news/Homecoming-queen-gives-crown-to-friend-who-lost-mother-to-cancer-575403041.html>homecoming</a> despite losing her mother to <a class="me a" href=#>cancer</a> because she promised her mother she would not miss it.
