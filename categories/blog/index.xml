あれからすでに２年の歳月が流れようとしてます。
元々馴れ初めは２０１１年で、
３年半の交際を経ての結婚でしたが、
互いに子持ちだっという背景から、
結婚当初は難しい意見が多くありました。
実際に２年の月日を迎えて、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんの結婚生活は、
どれだけ順調なのか？
週刊誌などでは、
比較的にネガティブな記事もありますが、
本当のところはどのような感じなのか・・・。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりは離婚する？
互いに再婚を果たして僅かな時間しか流れてませんが、
某週刊誌などでは、雲行きがあやしいという内容の記事が出てます。
忙しく全国を駆け巡る吉井和哉さんのことを考えると、
ファンにとっては面白い内容ではないですね・・・。
12月15日発売の「女性自身」（光文社）では、怪しい雲行きを伝えている。同誌記事によると、眞鍋にとって初めての子供がまだ生後2カ月であるにも関わらず、吉井は育児のサポートを一切行わないという。「吉井が育児をなにもサポートしてくれないため、眞鍋が『もう離婚しちゃおうかな』と周囲に愚痴っている」という内容の芸能関係者のコメントもあり、穏やかではない。
同誌は都内の高級スーパーでひとり買い物を終えた眞鍋を直撃取材。眞鍋は記者の出産を祝う言葉に「ありがとうございます」と笑顔で応答し、「吉井さんとの夫婦関係はどうですか？」との質問には「取材は直接お答えすることはできないんです」とにこやかなままで答えたという。笑顔の裏にある真意は？眞鍋の所属事務所は、別居や不仲について「離婚は絶対にありません」と宣言している。引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html?_p=2
吉井和哉さんがすでに育児にネガティブとされてますが、
これはあくま憶測でしかなく、
実際は、ライブツアーに忙しく、
なかなか心の余裕が作れないのかな？と。
眞鍋さん側は不仲や別居の噂に関しては、
離婚することはないと言及してますが、
やはり本人たちの口からはっきり聞いてみたいですね。
１４歳の年の差が単純に難しかったのか？など、
難しい事情は置いておいて、素朴な問題である可能性だってありますからね。
しかし、不思議なぐらいに、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんが揃った写真がないのが、
ちょっと違和感あるなとは、思います。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりの目撃と世田谷に新居の噂(フライデーではない) 吉井和哉さんが自宅に帰る姿が、
なかなか目撃されないということで、
別居してるか、吉井さんが一方的に出て行ったか・・・。
この部分に関しては、まだまだ確信ある報道はないですが、
ラブラブなツーショットがないのは寂しいですね！
子供が大きくなった時に、
３人で手を繋いでる和やかな光景があればなと！
だが、結婚の意思を公表したものの、すぐに入籍とはいかなかった。入籍はなぜか9月。8月には早くも二人の間に不協和音が鳴り響いているとの説が出始めていた。6月以降、二人が住むマンション周辺では、吉井の姿が見かけられなくなったという。身重の妻のサポートをすることなく、吉井がひとりで家を出て行ったとも報道されたが……これに対してはちょうど全国各地で開催される夏の音楽フェスに出演するためではないかと楽観視する向きもあった引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html
そもそも吉井和哉さんは暇な方ではないので、
単純に音楽に集中するために、色々と工夫をされているだけかも？
今年２０１７年も、イエモンは大きなライブツアーを控えてます。
リハーサル、演出の確認から、
吉井和哉さんの作業量は膨大なはずです。
普通のお父さんのように、
毎日、家に帰って家族サービスするのは、
なかなか難しいように感じます。
イエモンのライブが終わった後も、色々と忙しそう・・・・、
元ファンである眞鍋さんであれば、それを理解して支えることはできると信じましょう！
今年の１１月１１日には、
イエモンのドキュメント映画、
「オトトキ」が公開されるので、
そこで吉井和哉さんの私生活の一部は見れそうです。
きっと、忙しくて、忙しくて・・・な吉井和哉さんの姿が映ってるはずです！
結婚とイエモンの再結成、新曲、ツアーが重なるのは、
ちょっと時期的には難しかったのかなと思います。
ちなみにネット上で世田谷に新居を購入したような噂がありますが、
これが本当なら、まだまだ夫婦仲良しってことですかね？？
新居の話は週刊誌でなく、ただのネット上での話なので何も信憑性がないですが。

シュッと整った中性的なシルエットに、男の色気がしっかり残る岩っぽい美しさは圧巻であります。
ファンの間ではいつのTERUさんが全盛期だったのか、議論の的になりがちです。
見た目のこともあれば、歌のこともあり、さらにはファッションや髪型のセンスのこともあります。
５０歳を超えた現在は老けたという声がありながも、これまで公では見せなかった一面が見れ、ファンを喜ばせています。
今日はTERUさんの若い頃と現在までを振り返ってみたいと思います。
TERUの若い頃。昔から現在の髪型やファッション。一番イケメンな全盛期はいつ？ かつてはビジュアル系ミュージシャンの中でトップレベルのイケメン度を誇っていたTERUさん。
今振り返ってみると、年齢ごとに魅力の出方は様々です。
V系のジャンルは１つの形をずっと守って、ただ劣化してくパターンが多いですが、TERUさんは年相応の魅力を常に持ち続けているのです。
TERUの子供の頃・幼少期 TERUさんと妹さんの子供の頃の写真です。
まだ幼児なので、顔の形成が終わってませんが、顔のパーツが整ってて可愛いです。
きっと、妹さんも今頃は美人さんなのでしょう。
ちなみに妹さんは兄がTERUであることを言えないタイプらしいです。
TERUの学生時代・中学生高校生 TERUさんとTAKUROさんは高校生の時にすでに将来一緒にバンドで飯を食うことを決めていたそうです。
当時のTERUさんは細々とした可愛い少年ですね。ザ・バンド好きの高校生ってな感じです。
当時はサッカー部だったらしいのですが、坊主にするのが嫌で続けていた野球を辞めたそう。
当時にしてすでに自分の髪型などにこだわりを持っていたのは流石です！
TERUの若い頃（20代）。90年代のデビュー当時 TERUさんは上京してすぐに印刷会社に就職しますが、すぐに退社します。
その後、バイトをしながらバンド活動をしていましたが、金髪のロン毛で働ける場所がなく、バイト探しには苦労したそうです。
ちなみに91年に出会ったファンの女性と93年にデキ婚してます。
結婚した同年にメジャーデビューすると、TERUさんは一気に洗練されたV系ボーカルに変貌しました。
出だしは前身黒のレザーに、いかにもヴィジュアル系って感じでありましが、少しずつ装飾品が減り、素材を生かしたファッションになりました。
このドカンと売れ始めた時期のTERUさんが全盛期とだと思ってる人も多いそうです。
確かに、細くて神々しい美しさ・・・。
90年代の後半に、いろんな番組に出演し、その顔の良さは芸能界でも有名になりました。
90年代の後半には第二子の子供が生まれますが、PUFFYの亜美さんとの不倫報道が出てしまいます。
2000年に離婚するなど、栄光と、挫折、両方を味わった濃厚な20代となりました。
TERUの30代。2000年代。１番のイケメン時代？ 2000年代のTERUさんは、30代の色気が凄まじかったです。
当時はギャル男や、ホストのブームもあり、ヴィジュアル系に対する理解やリスペクトが多少なり復活した時代です。
TERUさんの髪型やファッションは１つのアイコンとされてました。
カリスマ性だけで言えば、この時期が１番の全盛期かもしれません。
また、GLAYメンバー全員のイケメン度が整った最高の時代だったと思います。
TERUの40代。2010年代。太って劣化したと言われるが人間性の良さ TERUさんは40代に入ると、多少、顔に年齢が出るようになりました。
10年代の前半は、かなり太っていました。
この頃がピークでしょうか？
しかし、その後にファスティングなどのダイエットを決行し、それなり体重を落とすことに成功しました。
ダイエット成功後は美しいラインは保っていますが、全盛期に比べてぽっちゃり感は残ります。
ネットでは「劣化した」など散々書かれてしまいました。
それでも50歳突入手前としては頑張ってる方で、色気も全然あるほうです。
現在のGLAY・TERU（50歳代突入！） 10年代から太った、老けたなどの意見が多かったTERUさんでしましたが、20年代からは可愛いおじさんとしての認知が広がります。
一時期はすっぴんで近所のドンキに現れたときを週刊誌にキャッチされたことがあります。
プライベートの私服＆すっぴんのTERUさんの写真はかなりレアです。
一部のファンは、ステージで観るTERUさんのイメージからかけ離れすぎた現実に驚きの反応でありました。
食系の雑誌で自身のご飯のこだわりを話したり、他ジャンルで新しい一面を見せました。
全盛期のようなイケメン度はありませんが、TERUさんという人間が垣間見れるようになった、とても好感度の高い時期です。
元々人柄が良いのは知られてましたが、、ここまで親近感が湧く人だとは誰も思ってもみなかったでしょう。
TERUの髪型。貴重な短髪とロン毛（画像） 歴代のTERUさんの写真を見て頂くとわかると思いますが、TERUさんの髪の長さには黄金サイズが存在します。
一般男児から見たら長めではありますが、ビジュアル系の世界で見れば普通のベーシックな髪の長さです。
しかし、昔からTERUさんは定期的に短髪するなどしているのです。
TERUの短髪 TERUさんは定期的に髪を短くするときがあります。</description></item><item><title>Jordan Henderson completes transfer from Liverpool to Al Ettifaq</title><link>/jordan-henderson-completes-transfer-from-liverpool-to-al-ettifaq.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jordan-henderson-completes-transfer-from-liverpool-to-al-ettifaq.html</guid><description>Liverpool and England midfielder Jordan Henderson has completed a £12million ($15.4m) move to Steven Gerrard’s Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq.
