He gained fame as a member of the Bee Gees, a popular pop group during the 60s and 70s. The Bee Gees are one of the most successful pop groups of all time, with record sales exceeding 220 million. They were eventually nominated for 14 Grammys, winning 9.</p><p>Barry has also had a successful solo career as a songwriter and producer. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 2015. Despite the loss of his brothers, Maurice and Robin Gibb, Barry has continued his musical career for more than six decades. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Barry is widely praised for his vocal talents and is considered by some to be one of the greatest singers in history.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career>Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Barry Alan Crompton Gibb was born in 1946 in Douglas, Isle of Man. As a child, he suffered serious burns in an accident involving hot tea, which left him with severe scalding and a two-month hospital stay.</p><p>Gibb and his brothers formed a band in Manchester, but it wasn’t until they returned to Manchester after relocating to Australia that they experienced genuine success.</p><h2><span id=The_Bee_Gees_From_Rattlesnakes_to_Disco_Legends>The Bee Gees: From Rattlesnakes to Disco Legends</span></h2><p>In 1955, the Gibbs brothers formed a group called the Rattlesnakes. Barry performed vocals and played the guitar, while Robin and Maurice also performed vocals. Initially, the group performed at small, local venues throughout Manchester.</p><p>After moving to Australia, the three aforementioned Gibbs brothers came together as a trio. While living in Queensland, the group named themselves the Bee Gees for the first time. Not long afterward, the group began to appear on television for the first time and signed a record deal with Festival Records.</p><p>By the late 60s, the Bee Gees had become quite successful with the single “New York Mining Disaster 1941.” At this point, drummer Colin Petersen and guitarist Vince Melouney joined the Bee Gees. After touring Europe and the US on the heels of this success, they released a chart-topping single in the UK entitled “Massachusetts.”</p><p>By 1970, Barry had begun his solo career for the first time, and the group seemed to drift apart. In the 70s, the Bee Gees came back together and released a number of smash hits over the next decade. These included singles such as “How Deep Is Your Love,” “More Than A Woman,” “Stayin’ Alive,” and “You Should Be Dancing.”</p><p>This marked the peak of their popularity during the so-called “disco-era” of the mid-70s. They became even more emblematic of the disco era when they contributed to the soundtrack of “Saturday Night Fever,” helping the soundtrack sell more than 40 million records.</p><p>Throughout the next few decades, Barry embarked on a solo career that continued up until the modern era. In 2020, Gibb announced his latest album, entitled “Greenfields.”</p><h2><span id=Barry_Gibbs_Marriages_and_Children>Barry Gibb’s Marriages and Children</span></h2><p>Barry Gibb married Maureen Bates in 1966 at age 19, but they divorced in 1970. Shortly after, he met Linda Gray, a former Miss Edinburgh, and they tied the knot later that same year. Together, they had five children over the course of their relationship.</p><h2><span id=Barry_Gibbs_Real_Estate_Investments>Barry Gibb’s Real Estate Investments</span></h2><p>In 1981, Barry bought a waterfront mansion in Miami for $1.58 million, equivalent to $4.6 million today. The property spans 16,000 square feet and sits on a 1.6-acre plot. Today, it’s valued at $25 million.</p><p>In 2006, Gibb and his wife purchased Johnny Cash’s former home in Tennessee for $2.3 million. Plans to renovate the historic home failed after a fire broke out, destroying most of the estate. The Gibbs later decided to sell the property in 2014 for $2 million.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCuwKupsmWXnq%2Bjec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbarry-gibb-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dates-tickets-more-details-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dates-tickets-more-details-hollywood-life.html>Dates, Tickets &amp;amp; More Details Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zac-efron-s-drug-addiction-how-the-actor-kept-it-hidden-hollywood-life.html>Zac Efrons Drug Addiction How The Actor Kept It Hidden Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zac-efron-s-drug-addiction-how-the-actor-kept-it-hidden-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
