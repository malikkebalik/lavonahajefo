<time>03 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Rapper Ice- T and television personality Coco Austin have been married for two decades! &nbsp;</strong></p><p>A prominent figure in both hip hop and heavy metal industry, <strong>Ice-T</strong> is a rapper, singer-songwriter, actor, and producer. Ice-T's back-breaking journey from gang-controlled Los Angeles neighborhoods to cementing an imposing profile in Hollywood makes him nothing less than an icon. The former street hustler has two Grammys and many esteemed accolades under his belt. &nbsp;</p><p>Born Tracy Lauren Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey, he had a grief-stricken upbringing after his mother's death, and his dad, a mechanic, raised Tracy on his own. Marrow began his career as an underground rapper and adopted the Ice-T moniker as a tribute to<strong> Iceberg Slim.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Everything to Know About Ice-T and Coco Austin's Marriage! &nbsp;</h3><p>Two decades into their marriage and Ice-T and his wife,<strong> Coco Austin</strong>, are still going strong. The couple surely has their downs like regular spouses but the duo makes sure that they show the world their best. The Grammy-winning rapper recently jumped in support of his wife after trollers slammed Austin for her racy July 4th post. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/342749137_1259277218021355_4897525572512513090_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688713622901.jpg><p>"If you have a problem with Coco, Why do you still Follow her?" Marrow snapped at a user, which is just a speck of his consistent backing for Austin. The duo first met on a set of a music video in 2001. Both Tracy and Coco definitely liked what they saw and started dating shortly after. &nbsp;</p><p>A year down their whirlwind romance, Ice and Coco walked down the aisle on January 1, 2002, in a secret ceremony. And by secret, we mean just a priest, pianist, and the love birds. Calling their wedding "the most romantic, beautiful moment ever", Austin said, "We just knew we wanted to be together, we were like yin and yang." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/331872891_946329060066783_2506920231270258734_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688713646433.jpg><p>Marrow and his wife have since collaborated on projects, celebrated each other's milestones, and fulfilled every criterion to be considered a power couple. In an industry that is categorically stereotyped for its shallow relationships and provisional marriages, Marrow and Austin have proved that they are a different breed. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>6 in the Morning</i> hitmaker once revealed that he and Austin drew inspiration from <strong>The Osbournes</strong>, who are undoubtedly at the top of the best-known power couples list. "Would Ozzy have a house if it wasn't for Sharon?", Marrow said while dishing on the importance of a woman. "I model myself after [Sharon]," Coco said while concurring with her T's statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ice-T and Austin are one of the most successful Hollywood couples!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The duo renewed their wedding vows in June 2011 and even filmed the star-studded ceremony for their reality show, <i>Ice Loves Coco</i>, which ran for three successful seasons. Marrow and Austin share a daughter, aside from the rapper's two kids from his previous relationships. &nbsp;</p><h3>Meet Ice-T's Wife and Kids! &nbsp;</h3><p>Ice T has proved himself to be a doting husband and father over the course of his marriage. The rapper has time and again defended his wife, who often draws attention for her steamy posts. Fans probably wonder how Marrow deals with the constant spotlight on his wife and her voluptuous figure, and you might be surprised to learn that it was Ice who taught Austin to embrace her curves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/336453747_761770235317854_2872520175217038001_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688713653686.jpg><p>"My husband really turned it around. He said: 'You have a uniqueness to you, why change it?'"<a href=#> Coco said</a> as she recounted her journey from being a little insecure girl to becoming a sultry, confident woman. Born Nicole Natalie Austin, she once used to work in the infamous Playboy mansion. &nbsp;</p><p>Coco worked her way up from R-rated films to work in mainstream shows, including <i>RuPaul's Drag Race 5, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Dr. Oz Show,</i> and <i>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</i> She is a mother to 7-year-old <strong>Chanel,</strong> born to her and Tracy in November 2015. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/334069048_987639448872329_5297345488589460575_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688713659612.jpg><p>Chanel grew up in the spotlight and is a cute fixation on her parents' Instagram. She made her onscreen debut as a baby on <i>The Tonight Show</i> and as per her parents, is a natural performer. Despite her best efforts, Austin has been mom-shamed in the past for some of her parenting choices. &nbsp;</p><p>"I'm underneath a microscope all the time and you don't hear what good you do. You don't hear the good, you just hear a lot of bad," said a teary Coco as she shared her plight of being a flamboyant mom. Ice-T is also a father to two grown-up kids, <a href=#>LeTesha Marrow,</a> 47, and <a href=#>Tracy Marrow Jr</a>., 31. &nbsp;</p><p>LeTesha was born to Marrow and his high school girlfriend, <strong>Adrienne</strong>. The rapper didn't have the best relationship with his firstborn as a young father. "I really wasn't concentrating on them, I was concentrating on survival," <a href=#>said </a>the Grammy winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/332078910_616179406984971_1574749191371770697_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688713665545.jpg><p>The oldest Marrow shares a cordial relationship with her dad and is also a mother to one. Ice-T's second-born, Tracy Jr., who he shares with his then-girlfriend <strong>Darlene Ortiz</strong>, is a rapper and singer himself. Professionally known as Lil Ice, he is a member of his dad's heavy metal band, Body Count.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqqr8Rmq2aZnpl6pLvCqGSaraOptq%2B%2FjJ6lna2inruoecyaqauhkZyy</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-ice-t-and-coco-austin-s-enduring-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./score-a-dozen-krispy-kreme-donuts-for-1-today-here-s-how.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./score-a-dozen-krispy-kreme-donuts-for-1-today-here-s-how.html>Score a Dozen Krispy Kreme Donuts For $1 Today: Here's How</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./harper-finn-obituary-what-happened-to-5-year-old-girl.html>Harper Finn Obituary: What Happened to 5 Year-Old Girl?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./harper-finn-obituary-what-happened-to-5-year-old-girl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
