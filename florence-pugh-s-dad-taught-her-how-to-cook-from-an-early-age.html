<time>09 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=# rel=follow>Florence Pugh</a> has always talked fondly about her parents — dad, Clinton Pugh, and her mom, Deborah Mackin.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her dad is a successful restaurateur, while her mother is a dancer and renowned actress who probably passed down her love of performing to her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that does not mean Florence inherited nothing from her dad. On the contrary, she had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learned to cook</a> from him and utilized it to start&nbsp;a mini cooking series on her Instagram during the pandemic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She noted she had felt a little off during the pandemic when her father called her and suggested she try cooking again, a hobby she had forgotten about.&nbsp;So she did.</p><p>The actress shared all the recipes that her father had taught her as a kid. In the first video, she taught her fans to cook “banged up veg [vegetables].”&nbsp;In another tutorial of herself making toast, she gave all the advice her father had passed down to her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“A crucial part of this recipe that I got taught very early on from my father is that there’s no point in having a good piece of toast unless you’ve got good butter with it, too,” said Florence.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Florence Pugh’s Dad?</h2><p>Pugh’s dad is more than just a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">successful restaurateur</a>.&nbsp;Clinton is said to have single-handedly transformed Cowley Road in&nbsp;Oxford, England, into the cool hub it is now.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The restaurateur came from a family with a catering background, and his parents once owned and managed a modest hotel. So he always knew he wanted to work in catering, and he earned a diploma in restaurant design.</p><p>With passion and hard work, Clinton opened the glamorous Baedekers to Cornmarket, the Mexican La Cantina Kazbar, and Cafe Baba.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also had a&nbsp;fine dining establishment, The Lemon Tree on Woodstock Road, the sophisticated Grand Cafe on the High Street, and many more. But the most famous one was Cafe Coco.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Clinton built Cafe Coco from the ground up, and it has a special place in his heart. He designed the entire cafe on his own and opened it in 1992.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, in 2019, the designer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold some of his restaurants</a> even though they were doing well. At 61, Clinton was tired and wanted to take a break.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Clinton Pugh Is a Loving Father</h2><p>One would probably think that with that many restaurants to manage, Clinton sacrificed his family for his career. But that’s not true.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Florence Pugh with dad and mom at the Oscar.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Clinton is a family man who loves his children and wife dearly. Apart from Florence, he is also a father to Arabella Gibbins,&nbsp;Toby Sebastian, and Rafaela Pugh.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In August 2022, during an episode of&nbsp;Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge, the&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;star said her parents and siblings <a href=# rel="follow noopener">moved from England to Spain</a> during her childhood because of health reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed she had asthma and tracheomalacia, which caused breathing issues. The doctors advised that a hotter climate would be better.&nbsp;And so the Pugh family packed up and moved to Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>“My parents were young and had three kids and decided to just ‘vamanos.’ So I want to do that when I’m older, as well. It’s such a nice way of just thinking and looking at things, and just picking up and going and living somewhere,” said the actress.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6cpL%2BmusKeZKmtl516pa3DZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflorence-pugh-s-dad-taught-her-how-to-cook-from-an-early-age.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gary-anthony-williams-details-becoming-bebop-for-tmnt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gary-anthony-williams-details-becoming-bebop-for-tmnt.html>Gary Anthony Williams Details Becoming Bebop For TMNT</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./catching-up-with-ruta-gedmintas-net-worth-relationship.html>Catching Up With Ruta Gedmintas Net Worth &amp;amp; Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./catching-up-with-ruta-gedmintas-net-worth-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
